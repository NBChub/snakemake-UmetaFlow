Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './resources/Contents/MacOS/sirius' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
